# StudySpace
Concurrent and Distributed Systems course project

Study Space is a web application whose goal is to allow users to reserve a timeslot within a library.

Within the application we have two different actors: user and admin. The user can login and logout, he can book a place and cancel reservations made previously. The admin can also login and logout, change the capacity and availability of rooms in the library.

From the implementation point of view I used Glassfish as Application Server. The user, through the web browser, can make HTTP requests.
